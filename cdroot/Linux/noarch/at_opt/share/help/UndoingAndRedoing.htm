<h2>Undoing and redoing</h2>

<p>State of the image is saved before any edit operation in
so-called &quot;Undo&quot; history. Length of the history, that is, amount of stored
image states is only limited by disk free space. The history is maintained throughout &quot;lifetime&quot; of
the window and is cleared when the Image Editor window is closed.</p>

<h3><a name="Undo">Undo</a></h3>

<ul>
 <li>On the <i>Edit</i> menu click <i>Undo</i>.</li>
</ul>

image to its previous state. This command can be repeated until the beginning
of the Undo history is reached.</p>

<h3><a name="Redo">Redo</a></h3>

<ul>
 <li>On the <i>Edit</i> menu click <i>Redo</i>.</li>
