	<td width=150 height="50"><b>CUPS</b></TD>
	<td height="50">Common UNIX Printing System (<a href="http://www.cups.org">www.cups.org</a>). It is a portable and
      extensible printing system for UNIX. CUPS uses IPP/1.1 to provide a
      complete, modern printing system for UNIX that can be extended to support
      new printers, devices, and protocols while providing compatibility with
      existing UNIX applications. The Unified Linux Driver package is based on the
      CUPS printing support.</td></tr>
<tr>
	<td width=150 height="39" valign="top"><b>CUPS backend</b></TD>
	<td height="39" valign="top">Backend is a special program that communicates
      directly with printers and allows printer drivers to send data using any
      type of connection transparently. Backend plays the role of a data pipe
      between the printer driver and the printer itself.</td>

<tr>
	<td width=150 height="76" valign="top"><b>CUPS filters</b></TD>
	<td height="76" valign="top">Print jobs sent to the CUPS scheduler are filtered
      before sending them to a printer. Some filters convert job files to
      different formats that the printer can understand. Others perform page
      selection and ordering tasks. CUPS provides filters for printing many
      types of image files, HP-GL/2 files, PDF files, and text files. CUPS also
      supplies PostScript and image file Raster Image Processor
      (&quot;RIP&quot;) filters that convert PostScript or image files into
      bitmaps that can be sent to a raster printer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td width=150 height="38" valign="top"><b>CUPS printer driver</b></TD>
	<td height="38" valign="top">The printer driver in CUPS is a special filter program
      that converts CUPS raster data into the appropriate commands and data
      required for a printer. CUPS raster data consists of a stream of raster
      page descriptions produced by one of the RIP filters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td width=150 height="9" valign="top"><b>CUPS scheduler</b></TD>
	<td height="9" valign="top">Like most printing systems, CUPS is designed around
      a central print scheduling process that dispatches print jobs, processes
      administrative commands, provides printer status information to local and
      remote programs, and informs users as needed. The scheduler (or spooler)
      is a HTTP/1.1 server application that handles HTTP requests. Besides
      handling printer commands via IPP requests, the scheduler also acts
      as a full-featured web server for documentation, status monitoring, and
      administration. The CUPS scheduler on a local system can be usually
      accessed at <a href="http://localhost:631">http://localhost:631</a>
      address.</td>

	<td width=150 height="89"><b>IPP</b></TD>
	<td height="89">Internet Printing Protocol. IPP is an application
      level protocol that can be used for distributed printing using Internet
      tools and technologies. The Internet Printing Protocol defines extensions
      to the HyperText Transport Protocol 1.1 [RFC2616] to provide support for
      remote printing services. IPP defines a standard protocol for printing as
      well as managing print jobs and printer options like media size,
      resolution, and so forth. Like all IP-based protocols, IPP can be used
      locally or over the Internet. Unlike other protocols, however, IPP also
      supports access control, authentication, and encryption, making it a much
      more capable and secure printing solution than older ones.</td></tr>
<tr>
	<td width=150 height="22" valign="top"><b>MFP</b></TD>
	<td height="22" valign="top">Multi Functional Peripheral. A device combining
      printer, scanner and fax machine in a single case. All the components of
      the device are controlled through common interface (usually parallel port
      or USB).</td>

      communication with printer or MFP device. Usually this is a parallel port or USB
      port.</td>

	<td width=150 height="17" valign="top"><b>PCL</b></TD>
	<td height="17" valign="top">Pinter
      Control Language. Hewlett-Packard
      created the PCL printer language to provide an economical and efficient
      way for application programs to control a range of printer features across
      a number of printing devices. PCL commands are compact escape sequence
      codes that are embedded in the print job data stream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td width=150 height="18" valign="top"><b>PostScript</b></TD>
	<td height="18" valign="top">PostScript is a programming language optimized for
      printing graphics and text (whether on paper, film, or CRT is immaterial).
      It is a page description language. It was introduced by Adobe in 1985. The
      main purpose of PostScript was to provide a convenient language in which
      to describe images in a device independent manner. This device
      independence means that the image is described without reference to any
      specific device features (<i>e.g.</i> printer resolution) so that the same
      description could be used on any PostScript printer without modification.</td>

	<td height="61">Scanner Access Now Easy (<a href="http://www.sane-project.org">http://www.sane-project.org</a>). SANE is an application
      programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to any
      raster image scanner hardware. While SANE is primarily targeted at
      a UNIX environment, the standard has been carefully designed to make it
      possible to implement the API on virtually any hardware or operating
      system. The Unified Linux Driver package is based on the SANE scanning support.</td></tr>
