<h2>If scanner doesn't scan</h2>

<p>If your scanner cannot scan documents, you can try to diagnose and to solve
the problem using the following recommendations.</p>

<h4>1. Check if a document is loaded into device </h4>
<p>This obvious mistake will be reported immediately after attempt to start
scanning.</p>

<h4>2. Check if the device is connected to host computer </h4>
<p>Make sure if the device is connected properly, if I/O error is reported while
scanning.</p>

<h4>3. Check if MFP port is not busy </h4>
<p>Since functional components of MFP (printer and scanner) share the same I/O
interface (MFP port), the situation of simultaneous access of different
&quot;consumer&quot; application to the same MFP port is possible. To avoid
possible conflicts, only one of them at a time is allowed to gain control over
the device. The other &quot;consumer&quot; will encounter &quot;device
busy&quot; response. This can usually happen while starting scan procedure, and
appropriate message box will be displayed..</p>

<p>To identify the source of the problem, you should open <a href="ConfiguratorPortsConfiguration.htm">MFP ports configuration</a> and select the port
assigned to your scanner. MFP port's symbol /dev/mfp0 corresponds to LP:0
designation displayed in the <a href="SettingScannerOptions.htm">scanners' options</a>, /dev/mfp1 relates to LP:1 and
so on. USB ports start at /dev/mfp4, so scanner on USB:0 relates to /dev/mfp4
respectively and so forth sequentially.&nbsp; In the <i>Selected port</i> pane you can see if the
port is occupied by some other application. If this is the case, you should wait
for completion of the current job or should press <i>Release port</i> button, if
you are sure that the present port's owner is not functioning properly.</p>

<h4>4. Check if your parallel port is switched to ECP mode </h4>
<p>Make sure whether ECP mode is selected for parallel port of your computer, if I/O error is reported while
scanning through parallel port. To do this, please, reboot your computer and open BIOS settings.
Scanning will not work via parallel port if ECP mode is not set.</p>

<h4>5. Can't scan via Gimp application</h4>
<p>Check if the Gimp application has "XSane:Device catalog..." item in the "Acquire" menu. If not, you should install XSane plug-in for Gimp on your computer.
You can find the XSane plug-in package on your Linux distribution CD or on the <a href="http://www.xsane.org">XSane home page</a> in the Web.
For more details, please, refer to the Help of your Linux distribution or of the Gimp application.</p>

<h4>6. Identification of MFP connected to parallel port </h4>
<p>On some modern Linux distributions MFP connected to parallel port can not be identified
"on the fly" when it is switched on. Switch MFP device on before Linux boot.</p>
