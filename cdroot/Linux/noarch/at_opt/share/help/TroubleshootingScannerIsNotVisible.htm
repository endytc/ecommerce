<h2>If Scanner is not Visible in the Scanner List</h2>

<p>Working scanners are detected each time you open <a href="ConfiguratorScannersConfiguration.htm">Scanners configuration</a>. This
detection results in the list of all devices responding to host computer at the
moment. But active (turned on) status of the device is not enough to identify it
as available scanner. Software support for the scanner should also be installed
in your system. That is, appropriate driver for particular scanner model is
needed.</p>

<p>So, if your scanner is not visible in the <a href="ConfiguratorScannersConfiguration.htm">Scanners configuration</a>, you should
do the following.</p>

<h4>1. Check if the scanner is attached to your computer </h4>
<p>Make sure that your device is connected properly via parallel port or USB and
that the device is turned on.</p>

<h4>2. Check if MFP port is not busy </h4>
<p>If all the above conditions are met, please, check the following.</p>

<p>Since functional components of MFP (printer and scanner) share the same I/O
interface (MFP port), the situation of simultaneous access of different
&quot;consumer&quot; application to the same MFP port is possible. To avoid
possible conflicts, only one of them at a time is allowed to gain control over
the device. The other &quot;consumer&quot; will encounter &quot;device
busy&quot; response. If the MFP port is claimed by some application, the scanner
won't be detected.</p>

<p>To identify the source of the problem, you should open <a href="ConfiguratorPortsConfiguration.htm">MFP ports configuration</a> and select the port
assigned to your scanner. MFP port's symbol /dev/mfp0 corresponds to parallel
port 0, /dev/mfp1 relates to port 1 and
so on. USB ports start at /dev/mfp4, so scanner on USB port 0 relates to /dev/mfp4
respectively and so forth sequentially.&nbsp;If you've got the only scanner
device connected via USB, the most likely it's on USB port 0 regardless of what
physical socket is used.</p>

<p> In the <i>Selected port</i> pane you can see if the
port is occupied by some other application. If this is the case, you should wait
for completion of the current job or should press <i>Release port</i> button, if
you are sure that the present port's owner is not functioning properly.</p>

<h4>3. Identification of MFP connected to parallel port </h4>
<p>On some modern Linux distributions MFP connected to parallel port can not be identified
"on the fly" when it is switched on. Switch MFP device on before Linux boot.</p>
