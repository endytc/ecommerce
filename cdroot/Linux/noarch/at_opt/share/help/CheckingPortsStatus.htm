<h2>Checking MFP Ports Status</h2>
<p>To check the status of any MFP port that might be used for connecting MFP devices,
do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="Configurator.htm"> Configurator</a>.</li>
  <li>Switch to <a href="ConfiguratorPortsConfiguration.htm"> ports configuration</a>.</li>
  <li>Select desired port in the <a href="ConfiguratorPortsConfiguration.htm#PortsList">ports
    list</a>.</li>
  <li>Look at the contents of <i>Selected port</i> pane.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <i> Selected port</i> pane displays the following information about the port:
port type (parallel or USB), name of device connected to the port at the moment
and port busy status. The latter status can be reported as &quot;Port is
unused&quot; or as description of the operation being performed over the port.
Possible formats of such description might look like &quot;<i>Application1</i>
is printing&quot; or &quot;<i>Application2</i> is scanning&quot;. Here
Application1 or Application2 are names of applications using the port.</p>

<p>If a port is occupied by printing or scanning operation initiated by some
application, the port becomes inaccessible for other &quot;consumers&quot;. In
case of abnormal termination of the current port's owner, the port remains busy
and cannot be claimed further. To relinquish the port, you can press the <i>Release
port</i> button. Please, avoid releasing the port while normal operation is
going on. This results in immediate I/O error and the current job is terminated.</p>
