<h2>Sharing ports between printers and scanners</h2>
<p>Any MFP device may be connected to host computer via parallel port or USB
port. Since the MFP device contains more than one device in a single case
(printer and scanner), it's necessary to organize proper access of
&quot;consumer&quot; applications to these devices via single I/O port.
Currently MFP devices cannot be used for simultaneous printing and
scanning, only one of the operations can proceed at once. If, for example, a
printer's job has been started, scanning is impossible until the printer's job
is finished. And vice versa, a document cannot be printed while scanning session
is in progress.</p>

<p>The Unified Linux Driver package provides appropriate port sharing mechanism that is used by
printer and scanner drivers. The drivers address their devices via
so-called MFP ports. Current status of any MFP port can
be viewed by <a href="CheckingPortsStatus.htm">Checking
MFP ports status</a>. The port sharing prevents from accessing one functional
block of the MFP device, while another block is in use.</p>

<p>When you install a new MFP printer onto your system, it is strongly
recommended to do this with assistance of MFP <a href="Configurator.htm">Configurator</a>. In this case
you will be offered to choose I/O port for the new device among MFP ports
solely. This choice shall provide the most suitable configuration for MFP
functionality. For MFP scanners I/O ports are being chosen by scanner driver
automatically, so proper settings are applied by default.</p>
