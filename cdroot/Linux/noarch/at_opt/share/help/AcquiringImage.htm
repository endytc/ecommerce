<h2>Acquiring Image</h2>

<ol>
 <li>Insert a page into the scanner.</li>
 <li>In the options pane press <i>Scan</i>.</li>
</ol>

<p>To cancel scanning, press <i>Cancel</i> in the options pane.</p>

<p>The scanned image appears in the new Image Editor window.
You may process the image further.</p>

<p>If the image does not fit to available virtual memory, the program asks to create temporary swap file on your home partition.
The swap file is intermediate data storage for programs. The size of the temporary swap file is approximately six times larger than the size of the image. The program deletes temporary swap file on exit.</p>

<p>Creating and deleting swap files takes several minutes. If you acquire big 
images frequently and want to save time, consider extending your computer's 
memory or increasing the size of Linux regular swap partition.</p>
