<h2>Main Window</h2>

<p>With <a href="ImageManager.htm">Image Manager</a> Main Window you obtain the image
from scanner or from file. Typically you set up the MFP device for scanning and
control the scan process. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Main Window contains Caption, Main Menu, and Toolbar in the
top part, Status Line, Options Bar, and Preview Pane. </p>

<h4>Caption </h4>
<p>Displays the name of the application. It also has
platform-specific controls: system menu, s Minimize, Maximize and Close
buttons.</p>

<h4>Main Menu </h4>
<p>Contains item groups File, Edit, Tools, View, Help. Menu
items represented in the toolbar have corresponding icons.</p>

<h4>Toolbar </h4>
<p>Contains buttons representing frequently used menu commands.
Every toolbar button has a tooltip and a status line hint. The combobox in the
left part of the toolbar selects the scanner device and updates Main Window
accordingly.</p>

<h4>Options Bar </h4>
<p>Controls the scanner attached to USB or LPT port of your
computer. You typically use Options Bar to start <a href="MakingPreview.htm">preview</a> or <a href="AcquiringImage.htm">acquisition</a>.
With Options Bar you can <a href="SettingScannerOptions.htm">customize device-specific options</a>, such as
Color Composition, Image Resolution and Scan Area Size. You can also <a href="StoringScannerOptions.htm">save
current option values</a> as Default Options or as a named option set. </p>

<h4>Preview Pane </h4>
<p>Shows a low-resolution image of the document you are going
to scan. Initially the Preview Pane is blank. To generate preview, press <i>Preview</i>
button. Each successive preview operation replaces contents of the Preview Pane
with new image. You can drag mouse within the Preview Pane to select image area
for subsequent acquisition.</p>

<h4>Status Line </h4>
<p>Shows estimated image size in <i>width x height = data size</i>,
and information about selected scan device.
If the image requires considerable amount of resources - memory, disk space, or time - the image size is shown in red color.
Occasionally Status Line shows the hint about selected menu command.
When the scanning is in progress, Status Line
shows the progress indicator and the <i>Cancel</i> button. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Main Window looks differently depending on scan-capable
devices detected at program startup.</p>

<p>If the Image Manager does not find scan-capable devices at
startup, the device selection combobox is empty; Options Toolbar and Preview
Pane are not shown.</p>

<p>If one or more devices are detected, Main Window shows the
device name in the device selection combobox and displays corresponding Options
Toolbar and Preview Pane.</p>
