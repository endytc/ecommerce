<h2>Samsung Unified Linux Driver installer</h2>
<h3><a name="Welcome">Welcome</a></h3>
<p>You are about to install Unified Linux Driver package.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samsung Unified Linux Driver package is the accompanying software for Samsung
printers and multifunction peripherals (MFP). The package supports printing
with all devices and scanning with MFP on Linux platform.</p>
<p>The primary goal of the package design is maximum convenience and ease of
use. The package contains not only printer and scanner drivers themselves, that
is, low level software providing a principal ability to print documents and to
scan images. The package also delivers powerful applications for configuring
your devices and further processing of scanned documents.</p>
<h3><a name="Dependencies">Dependencies</a></h3>
<p>Unified Linux Driver package depends on printer and scanner services provided by Common
Unix Printing System (CUPS - <a href="http://www.cups.org">www.cups.org</a>)
and Scanner Access Now Easy (SANE - <a href="http://www.sane-project.org">www.sane-project.org</a>)
system packages. These components are&nbsp;mutually necessary for the drivers to work properly.
In addition, Ghostscript application (<a href="http://www.ghostscript.com">www.ghostscript.com</a>)
is required for correct functioning of the printer drivers.</p>
<p>Installer tries to detect if the components are installed and have proper
versions. In case necessary component is not installed, it is recommended to
interrupt the installation by clicking <i>Cancel</i> button and to install the component
from the Linux distribution disk, Web site of the Linux vendor or
Web site of the vendor of missing environment component (see references above).<br>
There is possibility to ignore absence of an environment component. In such a case
press <i>Skip All</i> button to proceed to further
installation stage. If environment components are skipped, please, do not forget to install them
before usage of the Unified Linux Driver.<br>
In any case <b>CUPS must be installed before Unified Linux Driver</b>, or printing will not be available.
If you did installation without CUPS and would like to install CUPS later, you should uninstall
Unified Linux Driver, install CUPS and then install Unified Linux Driver again.
</p>
<p><b>Note. If printer or MFP device is connected to parallel port, the device
should be switched on before Linux boot to be identified by Installer.
